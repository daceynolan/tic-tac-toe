# Tic-Tac-Toe

When I first began my journey learning React, I came across [React's official tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) building a Tic-Tac-Toe game. At the end of the tutorial, the article challenges the reader to make improvements to the finished application.

After I gained a better understanding about React, I decided to accept their challenge. I had just completed a course on React Hooks and wanted to test my knowledge by converting the state of this application to React Hooks. I added input tags that allowed the users to customize their display name. I displayed the winner's name at the top of the board and highlighted the winning squares. I created a modal component that rendered rules for playing the game. I also created a reset button that would update my state to their original values.
