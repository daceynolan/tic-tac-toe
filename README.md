# Tic-Tac-Toe

### Purpose

Early on in my journey to become a developer, I followed the [React's official tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) building tic-tac-toe, but not longer after, React 16.8 was released and hooks were officially introduced. The tutorial was never updated, but I wanted to challenge myself to refactor the code to utilize hooks and add new features to the game.

### Development Focus

- Refactored class-based components to use hooks instead
  - Primarily focused on `useEffect` and `useState`
- Added additional features such as player names, animations, instruction modal, and a reset button
- Improved the overall styling of the game board
