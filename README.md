# Tic-Tac-Toe

### Purpose

When I first began my journey learning React, I came across [React's official tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) building a Tic-Tac-Toe game. At the end of the tutorial, the article challenges the reader to make improvements to the finished application.

After I gained a better understanding on React, I decided to revisit the application and refactor it with my own improvements.

### Development Focus

- Refactored class-based components to use hooks instead
  - Primarily focused on `useEffect` and `useState`
- Added additional features such as player names, animations, instruction modal, and a reset button
- Improved the overall styling of the game board
